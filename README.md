# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
A C++ program that simulates and compares CPU scheduling algorithms by reading process data from an input file and writing results to an output file for analysis. The program:

Reads process details (burst time, priority, queue ID) from an input text file.

Implements FCFS (First Come First Serve), SJF (Shortest Job First), and Priority Scheduling.

Calculates waiting time and average waiting time for each queue.

Outputs results to a file, making it easy to compare scheduling performance.
